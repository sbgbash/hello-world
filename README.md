# hello-world
My initiation into GitHub
Well, I enjoy science, learning and thinking about challenging problems. I hope that I can live a good healthy life and get the most out of the short time we get here on earth!

I am an Electrical Engineer by trade, but I am currently getting my Masters in Computer Engineering. I want to focus on computer archetecture. I enjoy low level languages like C and assembly. I am even proficient in C++. 

I am open to learning anything new and will post some of my school assignments on here.
