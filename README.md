# hello-world
My initiation into GitHub -
Well, I enjoy science, learning and thinking about challenging problems. I hope that I can live a good healthy life and get the most out of the short time we get here on earth!

I am an Electrical Engineer by trade, and currently exploring subjects in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

I am open to learning anything new and will post some of my current projects here.
